This project was created to facilitate learning of reading and writing Chinese. It reads chinese books from 'sto.cx', parses them, and outputs static html files with the following functionality:

- Chinese text found on the page is parsed into Chinese tokens
- Displays pinyin of the found token
- Displays definitions of found tokens in the chinese text

### Instructions

2. Create .venv 
```
virtualenv .venv
```
3. Install requirements from Pipfile 
```
pipenv install
```
4. Run `./src/script.py $book` where `book` is the number of a book found on 'sto.cx'
5. Wait. Books usually take ~1-2min
5. Output files are found at ./out/

### Cleanup
1. Run the command to empty out the artifacts generated by the script
